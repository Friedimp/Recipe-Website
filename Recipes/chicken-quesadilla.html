    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
        <li>Kosher or sea salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Eight 8-inch flour tortillas</li>
        <li>6 ounces cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 medium red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>In a large pot, cover the chicken breasts with water. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until cooked through.<br>
        Remove the chicken from the water and let cool. Cut the chicken into bite-size pieces, season with salt and pepper and set aside.</p> </li>
        <li><p>Spread half of the cheese on top of 4 tortillas. Top with the chicken and red onions. Add a final layer of cheese and gently spread the filling<br>
            evenly around each tortilla. Top with cilantro and the remaining tortillas.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Place a filled tortilla on the pan, and cook the tortilla for about 3 minutes or until<br>
            the bottom is golden. Carefully flip the quesadilla and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes until the second side is golden and the cheese is completely melted.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove from the pan and repeat with the remaining quesadillas. Allow each to cool for a few minutes before cutting into 4 to 6 pieces.</p></li>
    </ol>
