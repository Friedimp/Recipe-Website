    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil (such as grapeseed)</li>
        <li>¼ cup sliced spring onion bulb (from 1 large spring onion),<br>
             sliced green garlic bulbs, or sliced ramp bulb and green</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock or lower-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crème fraîche</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped mixed tender fresh herbs <br>
            (such as tarragon, dill, chives, and parsley)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>     
    </ul>
    <p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Sprinkle chicken evenly with 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Heat oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium. Cook chicken, skin side down, 
            <br>until skin is golden brown and crispy, 15 to 18 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Flip the chicken breasts and cook skin side up, until a thermometer inserted in thickest portion of chicken registers 160°F, about 15 minutes. 
            <br>Transfer to a plate. Reserve 1 tablespoon of drippings in skillet.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat reserved drippings in skillet over medium-high. Add spring onion; cook, stirring often, until softened, about 1 minute.  Simmer over medium-high, 
            <br>stirring occasionally to loosen browned bits on bottom of skillet, until reduced by about half, 1 to 2 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add stock; cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture has reduced to about 2/3 cup and just barely coats back of a spoon, 4 to 6 minutes. Reduce 
            <br>heat to low; stir in crème fraîche until just melted, about 30 seconds.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove from heat; stir in herbs and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Serve alongside cooked chicken.</p></li>
